    "## Introduction to pointers\n",
    "Some say that pointers are one of the hardest thing to learn in C. But if you understand them, they can be really fun. You can do magic with them. To start learning them, we need basic knowledge about memory. So, we have a program with many variables and they all have some value. The values are saved in memory. We can think of the memory as a dock with containers. Each container has an ID or address and each value is stored in one of the containers. To go back to our program, each variable can be seen as container of a value and that container has an address. To get an address of a container we use special operator `&`."

    "## Static pointer vs Dynamic pointer\n",
    "Static and dynamic pointer is just another naming for compile-time and runtime pointer. The concepts are identical to to the ones we discussed with arrays. Compile-time pointers have a fixed value and cannot be changed when the program is run. On the other hand, runtime pointers can be changed when running the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "To look at the concepts a little bit deeper, we have basically 3 parts of memory for any program. The first part is **static memory**, where global variables and static variables are stored. The socond part is called **the stack**. It is used for function calling and local variables. It can grow and shrink. The last one is **the heap**. It is a large pool of memory that can be used dynamically (on runtime). \n",
    "\n",
    "If we define a pointer by `type* ptr = &var` then this pointer will be static pointer. To define a dynamic pointer we use `void* malloc(size_t size)` function where we need to define the `size` of our pointer. \n",
    "\n",
    "`int* ptr = (int*) malloc( sizeof(int) );`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Warning!** Every dynamic pointer must be freed when we stop using it or we will have *a memory leak*. Memory leak is basically a memory that we don't have the access to anymore. Too free up the pointer we use the function `void free(void* ptr)`. Bellow is an example of producing memory leak"
