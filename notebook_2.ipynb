    "## Introduction to pointers\n",
    "Some say that pointers are one of the hardest thing to learn in C. But if you understand them, they can be really fun. You can do magic with them. To start learning them, we need basic knowledge about memory. So, we have a program with many variables and they all have some value. The values are saved in memory. We can think of the memory as a dock with containers. Each container has an ID or address and each value is stored in one of the containers. To go back to our program, each variable can be seen as container of a value and that container has an address. To get an address of a container we use special operator `&`."
